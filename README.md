# NPC Dialogue and Quest System

## Overview
This project involves creating an NPC dialogue system for a game. The dialogue is structured using XML files, and NPCs offer quests with specific objectives, character interactions, and rewards. The current work is based on templates from existing NPCs, and new quests will be added progressively.
